### Content

The source I'm using to learn my tool is [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/). I'm learning my tool by running the code and eventually changing it. I'm also copying the code into my IDE and running it there. I'm also trying different things in the [Kaboom.js playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add). My idea for my freedom project is to create a platforming game.

The [platformer](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=platformer) tutorial is what I've been looking at tinkering with in the past. I'm thinking of changing some the sprites so it looks better and pops out, also people like the aesthetic better.

### Engineering Design Process

I'm currently in the state of Planning the most promising solution. For this freedom project, I want to make the code run how I expect it to without any flaws. Some next steps are to improve the code as needed. If there happens to be a mistake in the code, I must debug and improve it to make it work properly. Outside people are gonna be viewing this project, so I need to make it work correctly.

### Skills

Skills I'm using are consideration, attention to detail, how to Google, and time management. I'm aware that when my freedom project is done, it will be seen by other people. When I'm coding, I make sure there are no errors and I debug if there's a mistake anywhere in the code. If I don't know something about the code, I Google it and find the most helpful results. I want to make sure that I'm using my time wisely when working on my freedom project.
