### Content

The source I'm using to learn my tool is [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/). I'm learning my tool by running the code and eventually changing it. I'm also copying the code into my IDE and running it there. I'm also trying different things in the [Kaboom.js playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add). 

### Skills

Skills I'm using are consideration, attention to detail, and time management. I'm aware that when my freedom project is done, it will be seen by other people. When I'm coding, I make sure there are no errors and I debug if there's a mistake anywhere in the code. I want to make sure that I'm using my time wisely when working on my freedom project.
