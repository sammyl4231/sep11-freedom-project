### Content

During the past couple months, I've been learning my tool by tinkering with the code and running it and testing it out myself. Specifically, I changed the code a few times and ran it, and tested out the output to see if/how my changes worked. I did some tutorials on certain things. I've been testing out quite a few tutorials, like [platformer](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=platformer), [rpg](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=rpg), [pong](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=pong), [maze](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=maze), [draw](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=draw), and [concert](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=concert).
