For my freedom project, I'm making a platforming game. I have been learning my tool in many different ways. The codes of how to load sprites and add sounds, how to make what the levels would look like, and more. I just started working on my Freedom Project, and I've only got the background checkered screen to appear, but I'm having issues loading the sprites and their sounds. And I'm struggling what the levels will look like and how to make the platforms appear along with the sprites.

Here's an example from [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=platformer):

```JS
loadSprite("coin", "/sprites/coin.png")
loadSound("coin", "/examples/sounds/score.mp3")
```
