### Content

For my freedom project, I'm making a platforming game. I have been learning my tool in many different ways. The codes of how to load sprites and add sounds, how to make what the levels would look like, and more. I just started working on my Freedom Project, and I've only got the background checkered screen to appear, but I'm having issues loading the sprites and their sounds. And I'm struggling what the levels will look like and how to make the platforms appear along with the sprites.

Here's an example from [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=platformer):

```JS
loadSprite("coin", "/sprites/coin.png")
loadSound("coin", "/examples/sounds/score.mp3")
```

### Sources

I'm using [Kabbom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=platformer) as a reference and to help me make my freedom project.

### Engineering Design Process

My current stage in engineering design process is Define the Problem. I just started coding my freedom project, but things aren't working how I want them to. It keeps saying there's an error of what sprite or sound is undefined. My next stage in engineering design process is Plan the most Promising Solution. I will ask my peers and teacher on Slack why my code isn't working and how I can fix it.

### Skills

Two skills I developed are collaboration, growth mindset, and embracing failure. I ask my peers and teacher for help when something goes wrong and how they can help me. I had bugs in my code and it wouldn't work how I wanted them to. So I consider asking on slack. I won't let my mistakes slow me down or make me give up in this project. I will also work on working on this project in a timely manner.
