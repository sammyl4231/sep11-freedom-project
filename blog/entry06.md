### Content

Today I presented my freedom project at an Expo to many judges. I told them everything I did to make my freedom project. I gave detials of what tool I used to make it, challenges I had, my takeaways, the purpose of my project, etc. During the expo elevator pitch, judges and alumnis were collecting information about our projects; what tool we learned and used to make it, challenges we had, takeaways from the project, and anything we can do in the future.

During my expo elevator pitch, some takeaways were to have my project's code functioning properly and ready to show to other people who will see it, make sure there are no errors or bugs in your code/preview, and to be specific when explaining the point of your project.

During in-class presentations, some takeaways were to ask for help when you need it, don't give up on what you desire or are trying to make, manage your time and do things in a timely manner, don't wait until the last minute, and try to find errors in the code of what's causing the preview to break.

### Engineering Design Process

When doing this project, my first stage in Engineering Design Process were to Define the problem, I looked at where my code was having bugs and breaking in my preview. My next stage was Improve as needed, where I had to fix the errors and bugs in the code, and see if it worked properly. But unfortunately, it didn't work quite as I expected it to. And my final stage was Communicate the results, when I was presenting my project to the judges and other students in the Expo elevator pitch, I was telling them every step of my project; how I started, how it was going, the errors I had, struggles with setting up, and how I fixed the errors.
