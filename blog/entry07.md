### Context

My freedom project was about making a platform game inspired by a popular game Super Mario. I used different Javascript concepts to make it, but however, many parts of it had issues. But then, after I witnessed these issues, I learned from them and improved them. From doing this freedom project, I had many challenges and takeaways. From how I got started to how I ended. I did an in-class presentation and showed off my project in an Expo elevator pitch. Judges saw my project, and asked me questions about it. Like what was the purpose of my project, challenges I had making it, takeaways from making it, and what I used to make it.
