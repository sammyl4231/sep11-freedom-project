### Context

My freedom project was about making a platform game inspired by a popular game Super Mario. I used different Javascript concepts to make it, but however, many parts of it had issues. But then, after I witnessed these issues, I learned from them and improved them. The JS tool I used to make this project is [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=platformer). From doing this freedom project, I had many challenges and takeaways. From how I got started to how I ended. I did an in-class presentation and showed off my project in an Expo elevator pitch. Judges saw my project, and asked me questions about it. Like what was the purpose of my project, challenges I had making it, takeaways from making it, and what I used to make it.

### Content

Overall, this freedom project really made me learn a lot from making it. After doing two presentations both in class and during the Expo elevator pitch. Considering advice given by my peers, my teacher, and the judges, I can improve what I've done so far in coding the freedom project, and maybe even add some things to it in the future, and go beyond MVP.

### Implications

**Pros:**

* Social
  - Inspired by the popular Nintendo game Super Mario Bros.
  - Exact in-game physics
  - Acts just like the actual Super Mario Bros.

* Global
  - It's impossible to do this type of thing irl
  - Nobody gets hurt irl


**Cons:**

* Social
  - You could get frustrated if you keep dying or can't get to somewhere
  - Could be addicting
 
* Game
  - Some parts have high areas where the player can't jump up themselves
  - You can fall off the levels as there is no constrain to stay on the platforms
  - If the player touches the goombas, you have to start over
