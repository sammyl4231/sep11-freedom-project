The tool I decided to use for my Freedom Project is [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/). I will use it to make a platforming game. When I first tinkered with it, I changed the code in a custom component turtorial, when the output was "get funky". One of the code lines was `Let isFunky`, it was originally false. The output said "Press Space to get funky". It worked when I did it. When I changed `Let isFunky` to true, the code ran by itself without pressing any keys.
