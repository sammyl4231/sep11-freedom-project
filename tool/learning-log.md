[Installation](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup)

* The installation feature of this tool is the easiest way to get started by using the [CLI Tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-kaboom).

```JS
$ npm init kaboom -- mygame
$ cd mygame
$ npm run dev
```

* The CLI Tool will use the directory `mygame` to preview the game.

    * You can see your changes when you edit `src/main.js` and refresh the page.

* Another quick and easy way to use Kaboom is getting a package by using a CDN provider.

    * CPN providers include `unpkg`, `skypack`, and `jsdelivr`. It's where the Kaboom package is available after it's deployed to npm

* It's easier to get other packages and use version control using Node.js and npm.

    * Using Kaboom with NPM requires `esbuild`, `webpack`, `parcel`, and `vitejs`.
