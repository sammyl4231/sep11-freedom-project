# Plan

## Tool: [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/)
## Product: Platforming game

For my freedom project, I will be makeing a platforming game. For this, I will be coding levels with grounds, enemies, points, sprites, sounds, and more. I will be testing out my code for everything I need to make this project. Using Kaboom.js, I can add sound effects to whatever happens whether I lose/die, collect points, win the game, stomp out enemies, teleport to the next level, jump, and everything. I will create a screen when I lose or win the game, a title screen, a settings menu, and a "how to play" menu.

### Breaking down tasks

To make things easier, I can start with one piece of the project at a time. I can start with how the background of the level(s) would look. And if I like how the background looks, I can start adding the grounds and platforms.
